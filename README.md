# Expense-Tracking-System
Edge Hill University - CIS1703 - Programming 2 - Coursework 1

Java Version: Version 8 Update 431

Allows the user to add entries of different expenses of different types.

**Requirements:**
- a machine which can run Java Version 8 Update 431
- a Java compatible IDE

**How to run:**
- confirm you have a Java IDE and Java Version 8 Update 431 downloaded
- download the .java file
- run the .java file by double clicking on it and loading it into the IDE
- run the program by pressing the designated run button

**How to use:**
- You will be prompted by the program to input a choice between 5 different functions: add expense, view expenses, calculate total cost, view expenses filtered by specific category or exiting the program
- add expense will prompt you to enter a name for the expense, the date of the expense (YYYY/MM/DD), category name of the expense and the cost of the expense. When all is chosen the entry will be stored
- view expenses views all expense entries of all categories
- calculate total cost just finds the sum of all the entries costs
- view expenses by category will only list the expenses with the specific category name inputted by the user
- The program will loop through the switch case at the start until the user closes the program or chooses the exit option

**Notes:**
- The program does not permanently store entries after closing the program
- Cannot remove entries unless you close the program, resetting the entries
(These are both improvements for the future)
